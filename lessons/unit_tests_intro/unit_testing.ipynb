    "Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development where individual units or parts of code are tested to ensure they work correctly. These tests help identify any issues or bugs in the code early on, making it easier to fix them. By testing each unit separately, developers can isolate problems and ensure that each piece of code functions as intended. This approach enhances the reliability and stability of the code. \n",

PyTest is a popular testing framework that simplifies the process of writing and exicuting tests in Python. It provides a simple syntax for writing tests, features for test discovery and organisation, and support for fixtures. \n",
