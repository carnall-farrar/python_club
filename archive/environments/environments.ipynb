    "## First git.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was written by the author of Linux as a way of tracking the changes that were being submitted to Linux by other developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "At it's core that is all it does, it keeps a record of all the changes that have taken place and the current state of a repository (think of a repo as just a big project folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used to roll back when something is broken and it can be used to allow two developers to work on the same project without getting in each other's way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some concepts basic git concepts that will be handy for this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are keen that you are all able to keep all your code / notes that you have made in these projects throughout the course, but equally storing everyones notes together is tricky but not for git!\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on the same repository developers will usually open a \"branch\" which allows them to go off and break as much as they like without interfering with the main project, when they are done breaking things and want to actually contribute for a change they can ask to merge their branch into the main branch of the project (this is called a pull request). As they are going along and making their changes they will be \"committing\" their changes, this means creating a checkpoint which can be arrived back at if everything goes wrong (think of this as just saving) but the difference being that it keeps a record of the unique identifier of the save such that anyone can pick it and look at it / use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this course we are going to ask everyone to create their own branch of the repo in which to keep their notes. You can commit them if you like or just ignore all of this rubbish for when it is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by going to the root of the repo (`cd python_club`) and running the git command `git branch <name>`. In order to pull new lessons from the repo (we are adding them as we go) you can run `git pull` from the same directory and the new lessons should be downloaded. If you get any errors then please ask and we will fix all you (git related) problems.\n",
